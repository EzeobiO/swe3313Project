# Technology Description
Shown below is a layout of all the languages and IDEs we will implement into our project!

## Languages
### • Java 
We will be implementing Java throughout the project. we chose this language because our team has had years of experience navigating through these works and feels most comfortable with these languages.

## Frameworks
### • JavaFX
Javafx implemented as a collection of libraries and other parts that work together to produce graphical user interfaces (GUIs), can be used to build high client-side applications. 
It is also open source so this will allow our team to work seamlessly with no issues.

## Storage System
### • SQL
We are implementing SQL as our database storage system. This is a no-brainer as SQL is the universal known language for database systems and our team is familiar with SQL.

## Planning
### • YouTrack
We were assigned to use YouTrack to create Gantt charts and Project plans to pace our team throughout this entire process. It offers a range of features that can greatly benefit software development teams and other project-based workflows.

### • GitHub
a popular platform for version control and collaboration offers numerous advantages for individuals and teams working on software development projects. We will be using it to create our outline which includes: Team members' resumes, Project plan, assignments, and Technology Description.
