# Technology Description
Shown below is a layout of all the languages and IDEs we will implement into our project!

## Languages
### Java 
We will be implementing Java throughout the project. we chose this language because our team has had years of experience navigating through these works and feel most comfortable with these languages.

## Frameworks
### JavaFX
Javafx implemented as a collection of libraries and other parts that work together to produce graphical user interfaces (GUIs), can be used to build high client-side applications. 
It is also open source so this will allow our team to work seamlessly with no issues.
