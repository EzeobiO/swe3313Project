# Coding Style Guide
## Coding Style
### Naming Convention
Camel Casing e.g. thisIsAnExample
- Exceptions to Camel Casing: Constants. e.g. SPEED_OF_LIGHT= 299792458

### Method names & Variable names
Method names amd Variable names should begin with a lowercase letter. e.g. public void setTitle(String t) { ... }, int hypotenuseOfTriangle = ...

##  Format conventions
1. Break long lines after 100 characters. Turn on your IDE's "visual guide" to see where the 100 character limit is.
2. Include whitespace in your methods, properties, etc. to increase readability
3. The position of open braces "{" should be the same throughout the program.
4. Put only one statement on a line so as for all lines to be read without the need for horizontal scrolling.

## Documentation
Document a program well so that others have an easier time understanding it. e.g. /** Return (the value of the sentence) "y is in list x" */
- Omit needless words.
- Use the active voice.
