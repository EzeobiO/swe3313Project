  - **Integrated with Java**

    Developers can make use of Java's advantages in backend logic and JavaFX's ability to create cutting-edge, interactive user interfaces. Using Java's advantages for backend logic, JavaFX enhances Java by providing a strong GUI framework for front-end development.
  
  - **Scene Builder**
  
    Designing UI layouts is made easier by the availability of Scene Builder, which supports a visual development approach. Developers can effortlessly see the visual depiction of their design thanks to Scene Builder's real-time UI preview feature.
